The user can update, 

Flow : Register > Login > Profile
Points to remember :
===================

● HTML, JS, CSS, and PHP code should be in separate files, none of the codes must co-exist in the same file.

● Only use Jquery AJAX for interacting with the backend (strictly no usage of form submission).

● CSS can be used but the form must be designed in bootstrap in order to maintain page responsiveness.

● Use MySql for storing the registered data and MongoDB for Storing the details of the user profiles

● In MySQL always use Prepared Statements, with no usage of simple SQL statements.

● The login session should be maintained only using browser localstorage (Do not use PHP Session)

● Use Redis to store the session information in the backend.

● Either host it in Netlify or share us your GITHUB project link.

NOTE : FILE NAMES AND FOLDER STRUCTURE SHOULD BE EXACT THE
SAME AS MENTIONED IN THE ABOVE PICTURE.
Tech Stack to be used:
● HTML
● CSS
